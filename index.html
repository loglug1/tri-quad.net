			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p class="card gray-background">Hello, I am Cam McKay. I've worked in K12 technology for 4+ years and expressed interest in technology for many more. Currently I am a student at SIUE studying Computer Science and plan to graduate in 2026.</p>
			<p class="card gray-background">Outside of technology, I ran cross country in High School and now I am a member of the SIUE Roundnet club. I also play Minecraft, Pokemon, Terraria, Rocket League, and other games casually.</p>

			<h2>What is Tri-Quad?</h2>
			<p class="card gray-background">Tri-Quad.net is my website that I use to showcase projects and support private game servers I run. Below is a list of things that you can find here.</p>
			<ul class="card gray-background">
				<li>General Tech Projects</li>
				<li>Random Fun Games I Make</li>
				<li>All About Me</li>
				<li>Downloads for the Gladecraft Minecraft Server</li>

			<h2>Technical Notes</h2>
			<p>Both the content and style of this page was written by me using raw html and css. When talking about real programming languages, I have experience writing backend applications using PHP and SQL, HTML5 games using Javascript, Unity Games for the 3DS in C#, and console applications in Java and C++.</p>
			<p>Outside of software development, I also have experience in the Google Admin Console managing user accounts along with a fleet Chromebooks. Outside of a professional setting I have experience running Minecraft and Terraria servers inside of Docker containers on a host that runs Ubuntu Server.</p>

		<div class="grid-object green card black-background firamono">
			<h2>Plans</h2>
			<p>So far, my current plans for this site are to improve the navigation and consistency between pages, along with linking other pages. I also plan on porting some of my Unity projects to the web and building a location database for my minecraft server so keep a lookout for those! ;)</p>
