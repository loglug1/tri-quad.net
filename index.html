				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p class="card">Hello, I am Cam McKay and I am a tech geek. I have 5 years of experience, administrating a Minecraft server, 4 years of which have been on centOS and Ubuntu.I find backend code the most interesting and I have completed PHP basics on treehouse. Currently I am working on a kiosk application for Freeburg High School to replace the current bulletin boards in the hallway.</p>
				<p class="card">I view myself as a very optimistic person, and as a result I do not hate many things. However, I do have a very low tolerance for stupidity.</p>

				<ol class="card">
					<li>Computers</li>
					<li>Family</li>
					<li>Friends</li>
					<li>Maps</li>
					<li>Strategy Games</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
				<p>After High School, I hope to further my education either through college or through a program similar to Launch Code. I think college degrees are not very important and I do not care where I go.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="grid-object green">
				<h2>Outside of School</h2>
				<p>Outside of school I mostly work on tech related side projects, whether that be programming or networking. Besides technology, I am on Cross Country and Track. I like casual gaming, nothing too competitive or time consuming.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="grid-object white-background roboto">
				<h2>What I am Proud Of</h2>
				<p class="card">I take lots of pride in my knowledge of technology but I still have so much to learn. I am also very proud of my grades and let it get to my head sometimes.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="grid-object white-background roboto">
				<h2>Digital Literacy Class</h2>
				<p class="card">I think it would be fun to do traditional application development, outside of web development.</p>
				<p class="card">This class is very easy right now and I hope to get above 100 percent.</p>
				<p class="card">My main problem with this class is that Treehouse is very painful to sit through especially if you are learning a second programming language. They try to teach basic ideas of programming all over again, even though they transfer from language to language.</p>
